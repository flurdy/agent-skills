# Handoffs — Pick a saved session to resume

Browse handoff files written by `/wrap-up` (in `~/.claude/handoffs/`) and pick one to resume. Companion to `/wrap-up` (the writer) and `/landscape` (the morning orienter).

## When to use

- Starting a session and wanting to pick up a thread from a previous one.
- After `/landscape` flagged that recent handoffs exist for this repo.
- Searching for an older thread — `ls ~/.claude/handoffs/` is grep-friendly, but this skill renders the metadata table.

## What it does

1. List handoffs across all repos, with per-repo counts.
2. **Fully detail** handoffs in the current repo as a pickable table.
3. **Summarise** handoffs in other repos (count per repo, not full listing).
4. Prompt you to pick one — only handoffs for the current repo are pickable.
5. On pick, render the resume block inline and surface the `cd` if the recorded worktree differs from pwd.

## Important — what this skill cannot do

- It **cannot resume** for you. It surfaces the resume block; you read it and act on the next step.
- It **cannot pick handoffs from other repos**. That is a deliberate guard — running commands against the wrong repo is the failure mode it prevents. To resume a handoff in another repo, `cd` there and run `/handoffs` again.
- It **does not delete or archive** handoff files. Curate `~/.claude/handoffs/` manually if it gets noisy.

## Instructions

> **MUST use the helper script.** Never construct ad-hoc `ls`/`grep` pipelines against `~/.claude/handoffs/` — they bypass the per-script permission allowlist and miss the repo-matching logic.

### 1. Run the helper

```bash
~/.claude/skills/handoffs/scripts/list.sh
```

Parse the delimited output:

- `---CURRENT-REPO---` — current repo identity (origin URL preferred, falling back to realpath of git-common-dir), or `NONE` if not in a repo.
- `---CURRENT-REPO-DISPLAY---` — short label for the current repo (basename of the repo root), or `NONE`.
- `---RECENT-WINDOW-DAYS---` — days used for the "recent" filter (3 default; Mon → 3, Tue → 4 weekend buffer).
- `---HANDOFFS-DIR---` — directory scanned (`~/.claude/handoffs`).
- `---HANDOFFS---` — one pipe-delimited line per handoff, newest first: `{filename}|{date}|{slug}|{cwd}|{branch}|{repo-key}|{exists}`.
- `---SUMMARY---` — `total=N`, `current_repo_total=N`, `current_repo_recent=N`, `current_repo_pruned=N`, `other_repos=N`, `pruned_total=N`, `unresolved=N`.
- `---OTHER-REPOS---` — one line per distinct non-current repo: `{repo-key}|{count}|{display}`, sorted by count desc.

Repo identity rules:
- Resolution order per handoff: (1) the **`Repo root:`** line if the handoff was written by wrap-up v0.2.0+, then (2) walking up the `Where to pick up:` cwd to find a parent repo.
- Identity prefers `remote.origin.url` so independent clones of the same upstream collapse to one row; falls back to realpath of git-common-dir for local-only repos.
- `.claude`-symlink unification: if a repo root's `.claude` is a symlink whose target lives inside another git repo, that other repo's identity wins (one hop, no cycles).
- Pruned worktrees still resolve — the walk-up climbs out of the deleted directory to a still-existing parent.
- `repo-key` is `UNRESOLVED` only when neither the `Repo root:` field nor the cwd walk-up finds a repo. Older handoffs that recorded a relative path may end up here.
- `exists=Y` means the original recorded cwd still exists on disk. `exists=N` means it was pruned — the handoff is still pickable (you'll resume in your current checkout or a fresh worktree).

### 2. Render the current-repo table

If `current_repo_total > 0`:

```markdown
### 🧷 Handoffs — this repo ({count})

| Date | Slug | Branch | Where | Worktree |
|------|------|--------|-------|----------|
```

- **Slug**: from the filename (e.g. `ab-1107-cta-event`).
- **Branch**: from the parsed line; `?` if unknown.
- **Where**: basename of the recorded cwd. Append ` (current)` if it matches pwd. Special cases: empty cwd → `—`; cwd ending in `/` → use the next-up segment, e.g. `worktrees/` → `(worktrees root)`.
- **Worktree**: ✅ if `exists=Y`; ⚠ `pruned` if `exists=N`. Everything in the current-repo table is pickable by definition (handoffs that couldn't be matched to a repo never reach this table), so no separate Pickable column.

If `current_repo_total == 0` and `CURRENT-REPO != NONE`:
`_No handoffs for this repo ({CURRENT-REPO-DISPLAY})._`

If `CURRENT-REPO == NONE`:
`_Not in a git repo — handoffs cannot be matched to a current repo. Showing global counts only._`

**Render this section exactly once, in this position.** Do not repeat the "No handoffs for this repo" sentence later (e.g. after §3's other-repos table) — once is enough. If `current_repo_total == 0` but other repos exist, the next section's table provides the rest of the context.

### 3. Render the other-repos summary

If `other_repos > 0`:

```markdown
### 🗂️ Handoffs — other repos ({other_repos})

| Repo | Handoffs |
|------|----------|
```

- **Repo**: use the `{display}` field from each `---OTHER-REPOS---` line (the script has already stripped `.git` and taken the basename).
- Rows already arrive sorted by count desc — render in that order.
- Do **not** list individual files — that's the point of "summarise."

Otherwise skip the whole section.

If `unresolved > 0`, surface them. When `unresolved ≤ 5`, list each one by filename so the user can `cat` it directly — a bare count is unactionable. When `unresolved > 5`, fall back to a count footnote to avoid clutter.

`unresolved ≤ 5`:

```markdown
_⚠ {unresolved} handoff(s) could not be matched to any repo (recorded path is invalid or its parent tree is gone):_
- `~/.claude/handoffs/{filename}`
- `~/.claude/handoffs/{filename}`
```

Pull the filenames straight from the `---HANDOFFS---` section where `repo-key=UNRESOLVED`. Render in the same newest-first order the script emits.

`unresolved > 5`:

```markdown
_⚠ {unresolved} handoff(s) could not be matched to any repo (recorded path is invalid or its parent tree is gone). Run `grep -L "Repo root:" ~/.claude/handoffs/*.md` to find them._
```

**Do not add a global pruned-count footnote.** The Worktree column in the current-repo table already makes pruning visible per-row. Add a one-time pickability hint immediately under the current-repo table (when `current_repo_pruned > 0`):

```markdown
_⚠ pruned = original worktree no longer exists; still pickable — you'll resume in your current checkout or a fresh worktree._
```

This is a tooltip-style explainer keyed to the column legend, not a count. Skip it when `current_repo_pruned == 0`.

### 4. Pick a handoff (current repo only)

If `current_repo_total == 0`, skip this step.

If `current_repo_total` is between 1 and 4, use `AskUserQuestion`:

- Option label: `{date} {slug}` (truncate slug if needed to stay under the chip width).
- Option description: `Branch: {branch} | Where: {basename of cwd}`.

If `current_repo_total > 4`, do **not** force the picker (the option cap is 4). Instead, print:

```markdown
**Pick one to load:** reply with the slug or filename (e.g. `ge-1344-login-state-decision` or `2026-05-21-ge-1344-login-state-decision.md`).
```

Only pickable rows (✅) are valid choices. Pruned-worktree handoffs are pickable — they just resume in a different checkout. If the user picks an unresolved one, point them at `cat ~/.claude/handoffs/{filename}` for read-only access.

### 5. Load the picked handoff

Use the `Read` tool on the absolute path `{HANDOFFS-DIR}/{filename}`.

Render the file content **verbatim** inside a fenced block so the rest of the session treats it as resume context:

````markdown
### 📥 Loaded: `{filename}`

```markdown
{file contents}
```
````

Then surface where to pick up:

- If `exists=Y` and recorded cwd differs from pwd:
  ```markdown
  **Switch directory:** `cd {cwd}` _(handoff was recorded in a different worktree of this repo)_
  ```
- If `exists=N` (worktree was pruned):
  ```markdown
  **Worktree pruned.** The original location `{cwd}` no longer exists. Resume from your current checkout (`{pwd}`), or spin up a fresh worktree (`git worktree add ../worktrees/{slug} {branch}`).
  ```
- If `exists=Y` and recorded cwd matches pwd: no extra note.

Do **not** run `cd` or `git worktree add` yourself — shell state does not persist across Bash calls, so the user has to run these themselves.

### 6. Footer

```markdown
---
**Next:** act on the resume block's *Suggested next step*. Run `/landscape` for a fresh orientation if more than a day has passed since the handoff was written.
```

## Failure modes

Each step is independent — a failure in one should not block the others.

- **`~/.claude/handoffs/` missing**: render `_No handoffs directory yet. Run /wrap-up at the end of a session to create one._` and stop.
- **Empty directory**: render `_No handoffs saved yet._` and stop.
- **Not in a git repo**: render the other-repos summary (everything is "other"); skip the pickable table and step 4.
- **Picked handoff is unreadable**: report the path and suggest `cat` — don't fabricate content.

## Notes

- Handoffs are written by `/wrap-up`. If a session ends without `/wrap-up`, there is nothing here to recover. That's intentional — the index lists `/wrap-up` next to `/handoffs` for a reason.
- File naming convention: `~/.claude/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md`. Collision suffixes from wrap-up (`-2`, `-3`, …) are preserved as part of the slug.
- Picking a handoff does **not** clean it up. Old handoffs accumulate by design — they're cheap and grep-friendly. Sweep periodically by hand.
- Repo matching uses `remote.origin.url` first, then realpath of git-common-dir. Linked worktrees of one repo share the same key. Two independent clones with the same origin URL collapse to one row.
- **`.claude` symlink unification** has two flavours:
  - **Non-bare** — A's `.claude` symlinks to B's `.claude` subdir. A defers to B's identity. Display is B's basename.
  - **Bare** — A's `.claude` symlinks to B's repo root itself (B is just a scratch state-holder, not a working project). A keeps its own identity (and display); when B resolves on its own (e.g. via a handoff whose cwd lands inside B), a one-level sibling scan finds A's bare link pointing at B and defers up. Net effect: both ends group under A, the "real" repo. The follow is one-hop in either direction, so reciprocal links don't cycle.
- Pruned-worktree handoffs are pickable: the script walks up the recorded path to find the parent repo, so even after `git worktree remove` the handoff still groups correctly. When picked, the user resumes from their current checkout (or creates a fresh worktree).
